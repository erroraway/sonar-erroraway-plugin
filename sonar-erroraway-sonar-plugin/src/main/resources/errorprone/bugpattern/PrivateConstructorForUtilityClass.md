Utility classes are classes that only include static members and are not
designed to be instantiated, for example `java.lang.Math` or `java.util.Arrays`.

In the absence of explicit constructors, however, the compiler provides a
public, parameterless default constructor. To a user, this constructor is
indistinguishable from any other. It is not uncommon for a published API to
accidentally include a public constructor for a class intended to be
uninstantiable.

To prevent users from instantiating classes that are not designed to be
instantiated, you can add a private constructor:

```java
public class UtilityClass {
  private UtilityClass() {}
}
```
