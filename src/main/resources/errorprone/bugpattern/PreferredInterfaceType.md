Where possible, prefer referring to some types by a subtype which conveys more
information. For example: `ImmutableList` conveys more information (the
[immutability][javadoc] of the type) than `List`, `List` conveys more
information than `Collection`, and `ListMultimap` conveys more information than
`Multimap`.

This is consistent with [Effective Java 3rd Edition ยง64][ej3e-64], which says to
refer to objects by their interfaces.

*   Guava's immutable collection classes offer meaningful behavioral
    guarantees -- they are not merely a specific implementation as in the case
    of, say, `ArrayList`. They should be treated as interfaces in every
    important sense of the word.
*   Similarly, `Multimap` was designed as a superinterface for `ListMultimap`
    and `SetMultimap` which should [rarely be referred to directly][multimap].

That is, prefer this:

```java
ImmutableList<String> getCountries() {
  return ImmutableList.of("Denmark", "Norway", "Sweden");
}
```

to this:

```java
List<String> getCountries() {
  return ImmutableList.of("Denmark", "Norway", "Sweden");
}
```

TIP: Using the immutable type for the method return type allows Error Prone to
prevent accidental attempts to modify the collection at compile-time (see
[`DoNotCall`]).
