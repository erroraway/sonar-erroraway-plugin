A method or constructor with one or more parameters whose declaration is
annotated with the `@CompileTimeConstant` type annotation must only be invoked
with corresponding actual parameters that are computed as compile-time constant
expressions, specifically expressions that:

*   the Java compiler can determine a constant value for at compile time (see
    [JLS ยง15.28](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.28)),
    or
*   consist of the literal {@code null}, or
*   consist of a single identifier, where the identifier is a formal method
    parameter or class field that is effectively final and has the
    `@CompileTimeConstant` annotation, or
*   are ternary expressions with both branches being compile-time constants, or
*   are formed from the concatenation of other compile time constant `String`s,
    or
*   are Guava immutable collection factories with compile-time constant entries.

For example, the following are valid compile-time constants:

*   `"some literal string"`
*   `"literal string" + compileTimeConstantParameter`
*   `debug ? compileTimeConstantParameter : "foo"`
*   `ImmutableList.of("a", "b", "c")`

When applied to fields, this check enforces that the field is `final` and has an
initializer which satisfies the above conditions.

Getting Java 8 references to methods with `@CompileTimeConstant` parameters is
disallowed because we couldn't check if the method reference is later applied to
a compile-time constant. Use the methods directly instead.

For the same reason, it's also disallowed to create lambda expressions with
`@CompileTimeConstant` parameters.
