The [Google Java Style Guide ยง6.2][style] states:

When writing tests that expect an exception to be thrown, prefer using
[`Assert.assertThrows`][assertthrows] instead of writing a try-catch. That is,
prefer this:

```java
assertThrows(NoSuchElementException.class, () -> emptyStack.pop());
```

instead of this:

```java
try {
  emptyStack.pop();
  fail();
} catch (NoSuchElementException expected) {
}
```
